<p>1981 Datsun 280ZX (NOT a turbo or 2+2)</p>
<p>This is a solid classic z-car, clean title, great interior, frame in good shape, no accident damage, clean title, just 89,000 original miles, 'garaged' since 1995<br />
  Can be a great ride with some TLC!</p>

<h4>History...</h4>
<p>I bought this car in 1986 from the local Nissan dealer, who had sold it new and taken it back from the original owner as a trade-in, with just under 60,000 miles on it. For the next 2 years it was my primary vehicle, so it spent some time on New York winter highways. But it wasn't long before I needed a family car and it became a rarely-driven summer fun-mobile. By the fall of 1994 we couldn't afford to keep 3 cars on the road so I drove the car into the barn (not a 'working' barn -- no hay or animals), pulled the plates, and put a tarp over it intending to put it back on the road the following year when financial conditions improved. </p>

    <td>Well, one thing led to another and I never did get it back on the road. So it sat there until a few months ago when we had to do some work in the barn and the car needed to be moved. We pushed it out of the barn and I had a mechanic give me an estimate to fix up the body and get it running again. I'm no car expert so I can't vouch for what he said, but he thought the frame and the drivetrain were in very good shape and it would be a great ride again with some TLC. He said that he thought it would be a terrible shame to just junk it or sell it for parts. We thought so too, so it's been sitting in the driveway in a car bag while my wife and I tried to decide whether to fix it or not (we really love the car) and we finally decided that we just had to sell it.</td>

    <td>I wish I could say that it runs great but I really have no idea. The big inline 6 was running great when I drove it into the barn! Most of the miles on the car are easy highway miles according to both me and the previous owner. It was always well-maintained -- oil changes every 3k miles and routine scheduled maintenance -- and I have some of the maintenance records. I didn't do anything really to store it properly, since I intended to put it back on the road in a few months, so I haven't tried to get it running in any way -- I'm afraid that I might cause some serious harm to the engine if I didn't do all the right things after letting it sit for so long. I also haven't put a new battery in it, so I don't know what the condition of the electrical system is like, although it looks fine. The parking brake works, it has a brand new clutch with something like 30 miles on it, but the clutch cable seems to be broken.&nbsp;</td>

<p>As you can see, I took a lot of pictures, which should answer most of your questions about the visible condition of the car. I'll gladly take close-ups of anything that you'd like to have a closer look at.</p>

<h4>Bottom line...</h4>
<p>If you can work on engines and do some body work, and if you can invest a bit of time, this car would make a great restoration project. You could end up with a classic car that's worth as much as $10,000 or more -- the 1981 280Z was almost the last of the classic Datsun Z cars before Nissan came out with the heavier, fancier, rebranded 300Z series in 1983. That's what we took into consideration when we thought about fixing it up ourselves. But I just don't have the time or the knowledge to do the work myself and, well we just don't have the money to pay someone else to do it.</p>
